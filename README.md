## Projects done experimenting with VR and AR
These projects were done in Visual Code with Javascript, Threejs, Aframe, Ar.js, and WebXR. I've used the live server extension of visual code to prototype and test my code modifications.

## Trabalho 3
[Ambiente 01](https://arthurgonze.github.io/CG/T3/t3_ex01.html).

[Ambiente 02](https://arthurgonze.github.io/CG/T3/t3_ex02.html).
This was a test in AR with markers combinations. If you put the multimarker along with Hiro multiple cylindric objects will be plotted. If you put multimarker along with kanji a black rectangular object will be plotted.

[Ambiente 03](https://arthurgonze.github.io/CG/T3/t3_ex03.html).
This was a test with animation in AR, plotting a part of the solar system. The spheres have imported textures, animation(rotation), and movement(revolution).

[Ambiente 04](https://arthurgonze.github.io/CG/T3/t3_ex04.html).
This was a test with a multimarker that you can select different objects to plot and if you hide a letter the object will be plotted on another one.

## Shader Island
[Oceano](https://arthurgonze.github.io/CG/T6/water.html)
This is a project done in VR to experiment with water shader visuals. I've tried to replicate most of the ocean water characteristics without compromising too much performance in mobile systems.

[Ilha](https://karlaflorentino.github.io/RVA-2021/ProjetoIntegrado/scene.html)
This is the final project with two fellow programmers. They did the earth shader and the sky shader and I did the water shader.
